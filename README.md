# DigiMeals Open Recipe API
The DigiMeals Open Recipe API gives you access to (cooking) recipes stored in a highly structured data format. The recipes are broken down into step by step instructions with each of the steps containing "human-readable directions" as well as a set of easily machine-readable parameters. The recipe API is especially suited for applications in the smart kitchen space.
